  "detail": "In the end, I can't blame you, can I? It is not your fault that I chose to love you more than I loved myself. It's not your fault that I didn't give up on you even after you broke all our promises. It's not your fault I chose to forgive you for things you would have never forgiven me for. As much as I wish I could blame you, the way I loved you wasn't your fault. But I refuse to be ashamed of how much I loved you. I refuse to hate myself for being so committed to loving you. I refuse to feel humiliated for the number of times I tried to talk to you. I am not ashamed of the depth of my love. I chose to love you at the cost of my sanity. I know that this might end in self-destruction, but I gave you a promise and therefore I am the one to blame."
