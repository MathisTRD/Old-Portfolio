  "detail": "\"I used to think the worst thing in life was to be alone, no, its having friends that make you feel alone.\"\nIf I'm with friends and feeling lonely it's like being homesick except you know you should already be home. It makes you feel like a cheater and the one cheated on at the same time. And you start to wonder after some time; What is it with me, that I feel this? What is wrong with me, to feel so empty when I'm with those I'm supposed to love?\nThen the most important question comes to surface and it's the most lonely of them all. Is there anybody out there who could fill my emptiness?\n\"I'm not here, you may see me but I'm hollow\"\nBut what if you're lonely inside yourself? What if you don't miss someone but yourself? You don't have to miss a particular other person to be lonely. I think that one might actually be their loneliest when they feel lonely inside."
