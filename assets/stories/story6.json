  "detail": "I was talking with the moon last night\n\nThe moon told me something about the sun and I told something about you. So far yet so close. Never really able to see your full beauty. The real you. Not the shadows you cast, the rays of light you shine, the emotions you leave on human faces. Their relation is just like ours. So far yet so close. We have never been on the same page of life. A game of chase, nothing more, nothing less. Running after the small glimpse of you that I am trying to catch every day anew.\n\nHowever, it always slips away.\nRuns through my fingers.\nEscapes my vision.\nAn endless circle of desire and despair is getting worse every time we meet.\n\nBut what if?\nWhat if I am able to skip to the same page?\nWhat if I am able to catch the glimpse I was trying to touch for so long?\nWhat if I overtake you at the end?\nWhat if we would be able to live side by side like we used to?"
