  "detail": "I have come to realize\nI'm an addict\n\nI crave your attention\nWhen you're near\nI wait for others to leave\nSo I can pull out my phone\nAnd get my fix\nA simple reply is enough for me\nTo smile and sink into my chair\nYou're my personal supply of dopamine\nI'm addicted to how you make me feel\nSeems I can never get enough\nEven when I have you here\nBut does that mean it's not real?\n\nOnce you're gone, I go through withdrawals\nI get frantic that you're not close\nI panic as the hours go by\nAnd I'm left without your voice\nTo soothe my soul\nSo I sit and wait as my world seems\nTo slowly break until you message me\nAnd dopamine hits my veins once again."
