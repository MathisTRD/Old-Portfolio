  "detail": "hey,\nI'm sorry that you tried so desperately to fix others when your own hands were shaking. I'm sorry there were days when smiling hurt but you forced yourself to laugh so that no one had to worry about you. I'm sorry you gave all of your time and effort to people that didn't give the same back. I'm sorry that there were nights when you cried yourself to sleep and no one bothered to understand why you're feeling this way. I'm sorry some people made you feel like you're hard to love. you're so strong. I'm proud of you."
