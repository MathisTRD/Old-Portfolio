  "detail": "Loneliness is not often kind to me. It is the type of ailment that poisons me, and infects my lens of existence.\n\nIt makes you look inwards, but not always in the right ways. It often ferments into a bitter resentment, into a bleak understanding of the world, because for all you crave for someone there is no one around. Is there something wrong with you, or the world, or both? It hurts, to be surrounded by that kind of isolation for so long. It pervades you, and it feels as though it is the only thing that makes you.\n\nThere's a certain way I've always yearned to be understood. There's a specific reciprocity that I think that I deserve. And my feelings on that matter haven't really changed much, but my expectations have, because the only person I can depend on to give me that is myself. Because, I need to stop searching externally for something that lies within. I will lose people, and they will lose me, and we will all make mistakes we regret. I'm trying to be okay with that; I'm trying to feel that peace. And I do, because every time I feel the sun's warmth on my shoulder, and the breeze through my hair, and all the small things I often ignore, none of it seems to matter anymore. And, just maybe, if someone really understood me, it would strip away the magic that I know sits in my soul. I can remind myself that I am more beautiful than I know, and write feelings of inimitable emotion that pale in comparison to what's in my heart. I can let go, even if I don't want to, even if I don't always get to say goodbye. I can remember that death cradles beginning. That loneliness means the birth of something new. That I am born anew."
