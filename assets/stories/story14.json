  "detail": "You found a spark inside of me. A spark of hope. You were the only one who could possibly find it. You fed it, protected it, kept it warm. You were the reason why the spark eventually started growing. You were the reason why the spark found a new home. You were the reason why the spark turned into a feeling. A feeling of hope. A feeling of joy. A feeling of acceptance for who I am. Then you left. And the feeling turned back into a spark. A spark without anyone to hold on. Without anyone carrying. Without hope. And the spark went back. Back into the deepest parts of my soul. Even deeper than last time. Now, no one will ever find it und turn it into a feeling again."
