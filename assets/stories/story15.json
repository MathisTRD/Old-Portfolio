  "detail": "Why is it that I just can't get enough of the things that destroy me? Meet people I don't like, visit places I am scared of. Not able to move forward. Caged in an endless spiral of loneliness, self-betrayal, jealousy, and fear of losing people I love. Trying to hold onto them as close as possible while being scared of annoying them. Slipping through my fingers like water. A necessity that could destroy everything in its way. This would be me. I am the one standing in the middle of everything. I am the one that just keeps trying to find a way to let the world stay just as it is. Just as I see and feel it. I don't want it to change. I don't want my friends to go on with their life and forget me. Leave me behind. Like everyone else did. Why can't I let go?"
